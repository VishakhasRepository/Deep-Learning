# Step 1: Data Preprocessing

# Import necessary libraries
import pandas as pd
import numpy as np

# Load Yelp dataset
business = pd.read_json('yelp_academic_dataset_business.json', lines=True)
reviews = pd.read_json('yelp_academic_dataset_review.json', lines=True)

# Drop irrelevant columns
business = business.drop(columns=['address', 'city', 'state', 'postal_code', 'latitude', 'longitude', 'attributes', 'hours'])

# Filter for restaurants
restaurants = business[business['categories'].str.contains('Restaurants')]

# Merge business and reviews dataframes
merged_df = pd.merge(restaurants, reviews, on='business_id')

# Drop duplicates
merged_df = merged_df.drop_duplicates(subset=['business_id', 'user_id'], keep='first')

# Fill in missing values
merged_df = merged_df.fillna({'stars_y': merged_df['stars_y'].mean()})

# Extract relevant features
merged_df = merged_df[['business_id', 'name', 'categories', 'stars_y', 'user_id', 'stars_x', 'text']]

# Step 2: Chatbot Design

# Define chatbot purpose, functionality, and persona
print('Welcome to the restaurant recommendation chatbot!')
print('I can recommend restaurants based on your location, cuisine preferences, and price range.')

# Identify user input types and create chatbot interface
def get_user_input():
    location = input('Please enter your location: ')
    cuisine = input('What type of cuisine are you in the mood for? ')
    price_range = input('What is your preferred price range? (1-4): ')
    return location, cuisine, price_range

# Develop chatbot response system based on NLP techniques
def generate_recommendation(location, cuisine, price_range):
    # Recommendation algorithm goes here
    return recommendation

# Step 3: Recommendation Algorithm Development

# Choose appropriate recommendation algorithm
# Train algorithm on preprocessed data
# Evaluate and adjust as necessary

# Step 4: Integration

# Integrate chatbot with recommendation algorithm
while True:
    location, cuisine, price_range = get_user_input()
    recommendation = generate_recommendation(location, cuisine, price_range)
    print(recommendation)
    another_recommendation = input('Would you like another recommendation? (y/n): ')
    if another_recommendation == 'n':
        break

# Deploy chatbot on suitable platform
# Test and fine-tune based on user feedback

# Step 5: Optional Enhancements

# Implement additional features such as user profiling, sentiment analysis, and personalized recommendations
# Expand dataset to include more businesses and reviews
# Incorporate user feedback and ratings into recommendation algorithm

# One line motivation: Building a restaurant recommendation chatbot is a fun and challenging project that requires data preprocessing, NLP techniques, and recommendation algorithm development.
